Quickly learned and mastered the deployment process, enabling me to independently manage and drive changes across various services. Successfully conducted production deployments during my internship, demonstrating adaptability and the ability to work autonomously to support multiple services.
Successfully implemented the Gaia task, which significantly optimized resource consumption by reducing unnecessary instance memory utilization and resolving connectivity issues caused by prolonged idleness which involved restaging of the app
This also reduced the overhead of maintaining multiple repositories for different jobs.
Automated the triggering of the Gaia application using Control-M, establishing a daily schedule and incorporating failure alerts. This streamlined the workflow and improved monitoring efficiency.
Conducted a POC and  completed the implementation and production rollout within a condensed timeframe, despite it being a new process for the team.
Contributed to the PDR data migration process and thoroughly analyzed mismatches during data reconciliation to ensure data integrity
Successfully upgraded Java and Photon versions across various services, enhancing system performance and compatibility
successfully performed performance testing and production deployment for various services by understanding the process with in a short span of time.

**Java and Photon Upgrades for Enhanced Performance:**

Completed Java and Photon upgrades across multiple services, ensuring compatibility and improved performance. Managed deployments swiftly and efficiently, minimizing downtime and maintaining service reliability.

Optimization of Resource Consumption for Daily Job:

Converted a daily job into a Gaia task, which reads records from the Consnet DB that are still in PI and PU states and retries any requests that weren’t processed due to downstream downtime. Previously, this job consumed resources continuously, even when it wasn’t needed. With the Gaia task implementation, resource consumption is now minimized by running only as required, optimizing efficiency and reducing unnecessary load.
