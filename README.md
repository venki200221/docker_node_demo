Successfully implemented the Gaia task, which significantly optimized resource consumption by reducing unnecessary instance memory utilization and resolving connectivity issues caused by prolonged idleness which involved restaging of the app
This also reduced the overhead of maintaining multiple repositories for different jobs.
Automated the triggering of the Gaia application using Control-M, establishing a daily schedule and incorporating failure alerts. This streamlined the workflow and improved monitoring efficiency.
Conducted a POC and  completed the implementation and production rollout within a condensed timeframe, despite it being a new process for the team.
Contributed to the PDR data migration process and thoroughly analyzed mismatches during data reconciliation to ensure data integrity
Successfully upgraded Java and Photon versions across various services, enhancing system performance and compatibility
successfully performed performance testing and production deployment for various services by understanding the process with in a short span of time.
